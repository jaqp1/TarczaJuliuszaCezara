##  A simple encryption/decryption application.
An application developed using .NET Windows Forms allows for the encryption and decryption of text data. Users can input a text file, which is then transformed using an encryption algorithm, and also restore the original form of the text using the decryption function. The simple graphical interface makes the application intuitive to use. The interface also allows users to preview the ongoing encryption/decryption operations and analyze the correctness after the operations are completed.
